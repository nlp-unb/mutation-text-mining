#summary Comparative evaluation mutation impact extraction systems.

= Comparative evaluation mutation impact extraction systems: Open Mutation Miner  vs Mutation Impact Extraction System  =

To investigate the potential of the infrastructure for comparative evaluation and analysis, we adapted the Open Mutation Miner (OMM) `[1,2]` to produce outputs compatible with our infrastructure and compared the system with the mutation impact extraction system (MIES) `[3]`.<br>
We undertook a cross-evaluation of the systems â€“ MIES on the OMM Impact corpus and OMM on the DHLA corpus. Moreover, both systems were evaluated on the new Enzyminer corpus.<br>
