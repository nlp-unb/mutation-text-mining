Two standard measures for mutation grounding performance evaluation are used:
 * precision, defined as the fraction of correctly grounded mutations (true positives) over all grounded mutations (true positives + false positives), and
 * recall, defined as the fraction of correctly grounded mutations over all mutations in the gold standard (true positives + false negatives).

The example below shows evaluation using *micro averaging* that, essentially, treats the whole corpus as one large document: it calculates global recall and precision over all evaluated instances.
