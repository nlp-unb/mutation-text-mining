[The Annotation Ontology (AO)](http://code.google.com/p/annotation-ontology/) is an open-source ontology for annotating scientific documents on the web. We use AO to model corpora annotations as well as the relevant parts of the text-mining systems results. Our annotations are metadata anchored to whole documents or specific fragments of texts. They are characterized by type and optional features. In AO, annotations are resources and realized as instances of the class Annotation. Each annotation has a hasTopic property. The value of the property is an entity extracted from text, e. g. mutation, protein, etc. This entity represents the type of the annotation.<br>
We distinguish between two kinds of annotations:<br>
<ol><li>Document level annotations are not anchored to specific fragments of text. They annotate a document as a whole, e. g. “mutation A is contained in document B”, “protein A is the topic of document B” . The annotations are linked to documents via the annotatesDocument property.<br>
</li><li>Text level annotations are anchored to specific fragments of text, e. g., “Mutation A appears in document B at position P”. Text level annotations are linked to text via instances of the TextSelector class. Text selector identifies a text fragment by its positions in the text or by its context. The property context binds annotations with text selectors.
